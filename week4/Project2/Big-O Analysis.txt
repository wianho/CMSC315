Big-O Analysis:
Point Class:

getX() and getY(): O(1)
compareTo(Point): O(1)
isBelowAndLeftOf(Point): O(1)
MaximalPointsPane Class:

findMaximalPoints():
For each point p1, it checks against all other points p2. This leads to O(n^2) comparisons.
Overall complexity: O(n^2)
drawLines():
Sorting the maximal points is O(m log m), where m is the number of maximal points.
Drawing the lines involves iterating through the m maximal points: O(m).
Overall complexity: O(m log m)
MaximalPointsApp Class:

readPointsFromFile():
Reading from a file and adding points to an ObservableList is O(n), where n is the number of points.
Overall Complexity of the Application:
The most expensive operation is finding maximal points, which is O(n^2), where n is the total number of points.
