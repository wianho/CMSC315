Test Plan:
The test plan for this program should cover the following scenarios:

Basic Functionality Test

Input: points.txt file with known set of points (e.g., (53.0, 288.0), (89.0, 433.0), etc.).
Expected Output: All points are displayed, and the maximal points are identified and connected with lines.
Verification: Check the console output for identified maximal points. Verify visually that the correct points are connected with lines.
Edge Case 1: All Points on the Same Horizontal Line

Input: All points with the same y-coordinate but different x-coordinates.
Expected Output: The rightmost point is considered maximal.
Verification: Check that the rightmost point is identified as maximal.
Edge Case 2: All Points on the Same Vertical Line

Input: All points with the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates.
Expected Output: The topmost point is considered maximal.
Verification: Check that the topmost point is identified as maximal.
Edge Case 3: All Points in a Line (Diagonal)

Input: Points forming a diagonal line where x == y.
Expected Output: All points are maximal since none are strictly above and to the right of another.
Verification: All points are identified as maximal.
Interactive Test 1: Add Points

Steps: Add points by left-clicking.
Expected Output: The new point is added and, if maximal, is connected with lines.
Verification: Ensure that the correct points are identified as maximal after the addition.
Interactive Test 2: Remove Points

Steps: Remove points by right-clicking.
Expected Output: The point closest to the click is removed, and the lines are redrawn to reflect the updated maximal points.
Verification: Check that the lines are correctly updated after a point is removed.
