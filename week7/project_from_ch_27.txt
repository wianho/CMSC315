(Implement MyMap using open addressing with linear probing)

Create a new concrete class MyHashMap that implements MyMap using open addressing with linear probing. For simplicity, use
as the hash function, where

f(key) = key % size

is the hash-table size.

Initially, the hash-table size is 4. The table size is doubled whenever the load factor exceeds the threshold (0.5).

When you create a new submission, you'll notice a template code. Your task is to fill in the missing code part indicated by "WRITE YOUR CODE".
